  books based on various criteria like title, author, genre.

- [Digital Resume](link): Brief description of the project.
  A web page resume built with HTML and CSS is a static webpage that displays my professional information,
  including my name, contact details, work experience, education, skills, and achievements.
  The page is designed using HTML for structuring content and CSS for styling, creating a clean and professional layout.
   It typically includes sections for my introduction, work history, education, skills, and achievements,
  and it may also feature a portfolio or project section.
  This type of resume is simple to share with potential employers and can be accessed online via a unique URL.
   It should be designed to be responsive and visually appealing on different devices.
